# Curriculum

## What you'll need installed

Before class begins on Monday, you'll need to have signed up for the following accounts, and installed the following software on your computer.

**ACCOUNTS**

Go to each of these links and sign up for an account:

- **<a href="https://github.com/join?source=header-home">Github.com</a>**<br>After signing up, make sure to confirm your e-mail address too, otherwise you won't be able to use the account. Github is the site we'll be using to share code and teach you how to publish your own webiste.
- **<a href="https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?service=wise&amp;continue=https%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2F%23&amp;ltmpl=drive">Google.com</a>**<br>You probably already have Google account (if you have a gmail account, you're good). We'll be using Google Spreadsheets the most, which you'll have access to from any Google account.
- <a href="https://app.datawrapper.de/signin">**Datawrapper**</a>
  <br/> A great website for creating data visualizations without needing to code.
- [**Codepen**](https://codepen.io/pen/)<br/> We'll be using this website to share your in-class exercises, so your instructor can check your work.

**SOFTWARE**

Go to each link and download the app onto your computer:

- <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/">**Google Chrome**</a>
  <br/>Everything we'll be teaching you about previewing and testing code will work in other browsers like Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer, but each browser designs how it works a little differently. Since we'll be demoing everything in Chrome, it'll be easiest for you to follow along.
- **Slack** (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/slack/id803453959?ls=1&amp;mt=12">Mac</a>, <a href="https://slack.com/ssb/download-win">Windows</a>)
  <br/> All of you should have received an invite to join the Data Institute Slack. If you've never used Slack before, it's basically a place where you can message with a group of people. You need both an account (which you should be able to set up based on your email invitation) and we want you to download the desktop app (which you can do by clicking on the Mac or Windows link above).
- **Sublime Text** (<a href="https://download.sublimetext.com/Sublime%20Text%20Build%203114.dmg">Mac</a>, <a href="https://download.sublimetext.com/Sublime%20Text%20Build%203114%20x64%20Setup.exe">Windows</a>)
  <br/> This app is where we're going to be writing all our code. It's completely free, and will occassionally ask you if you'd like to pay, but payment is not required. For both beginners and experts, Sublime is one of the best apps for coding.

**OPTIONAL**

We won't be teaching these tools during class, but we highly recommend them and we want you to have easy access to them in case you need them in the near future. Your instructors will also be providing demo videos for how to use some of these tools.

- **Tabula** (<a href="https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula/releases/download/v1.0.1/tabula-mac-1.0.1.zip">Mac</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula/releases/download/v1.0.1/tabula-win-1.0.1.zip">Windows</a>)
  <br/> Your best friend for when you have a huge stack of data tables in PDF format and need to turn it into actual data you can use.
- **Open Refine** (<a href="https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases/download/2.5/google-refine-2.5-r2407.dmg">Mac</a>, <a href="https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases/download/2.5/google-refine-2.5-r2407.zip">Windows</a>)
  <br/> A great tool to help you clean data (ex: it can recognize that "Saint Paul" and "St. Paul" maybe refer to the same city in Minnesota)
	- If you're on a Mac, and you get the error that Google/Open Refine is damaged, [follow these instructions](open-refine-troubleshooting.md).
